# On the joice of the web framework

I chose [Javalin](http://https://javalin.io/), a lightweight web framework that I have been using lately. 

The learning curve is flat and the amount of boiler plate code tends to be among the lower for java or kotlin web frameworks. 
It's style resembles Express.

It runs over a jetty server.
